<p>
  In this third post of our series, we turn our attention to the current state
  of COSMO Loop and its practical impact on our work at Cosmo Consult. Since its
  introduction, COSMO Loop has steadily grown into a key component of our daily
  operations, thanks to its consistent use by our team members. The focus of
  COSMO Loop has always been to streamline the sharing of resources and
  knowledge across our diverse projects and teams. The user engagement
  statistics we’ve collected not only show that the tool is being used regularly
  but also that it’s becoming an integral part of our project workflows.
</p>

<h3>User Engagement and Statistics</h3>

<p>
  Over the last 90 days, COSMO Loop has engaged 728 users — a figure that
  reflects our tool's integral role in the daily activities at Cosmo Consult.
  Each day, COSMO Loop systematically scans 358 DevOps organizations,
  effectively managing an average of 2,000 work items that where created or
  updated. This daily process has accumulated a substantial repository of
  480,000 work items, providing a rich pool of data for our users. These
  statistics not only underscore the widespread adoption and trust in COSMO Loop
  but also highlight the sheer scale of our operations.

<h3>Search Feature in Depth</h3>
<p>
  The search functionality within COSMO Loop is designed for simplicity and
  precision. When entering a term such as "Shopify Tracking IDs" into the search
  bar, the system promptly displays a list of related user stories that have
  already been completed. As seen in the screenshot, the filter pane on the left
  side allows for further refinement of these results. Here, it's used to narrow
  down the search to 'closed' work items and specifically 'user story' types.
  This level of detail in the filtering process ensures that users can quickly
  find relevant past work, providing a streamlined way to access completed tasks
  that may offer valuable insights for current projects. Also it's possbile to
  save different filter presets, or use metadata like the entity, organization
  or bc version, which where gathered via the export.

<h3>"My Work Item View" Functionality</h3>
<p>
  The "My Work Item View" was more or less a side effect and is a feature in
  COSMO Loop designed to provide a consolidated overview of work items across
  the organization. Prior to this, team members needed to navigate through each
  DevOps organization separately to gather relevant data — a task that was both
  time-consuming and cumbersome. Now, with this functionality, users benefit
  from an organization-wide backlog view. This unified perspective brings
  together all pertinent work items into a single, streamlined interface. The
  advantage is clear: it saves valuable time and simplifies the process of
  managing and prioritizing work. Whether it's tracking progress or planning
  ahead, "My Work Item View" ensures that all the information you need is
  readily accessible, facilitating more efficient and informed decision-making.

<h3>DevOps Client</h3>
<p>
  Enhancing the intuitiveness of COSMO Loop, we've developed an add-in for Azure
  DevOps that embeds the search interface directly within the work item card.
  This seamless integration pre-populates the search field with the title of the
  work item, saving steps and time for the user. The immediate benefit is the
  ease of use—there's no need to switch contexts or applications to conduct a
  search. This integration fosters a more fluid and natural workflow, allowing
  team members to find related work items, shared solutions, or past project
  details without ever leaving the card they're working on.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
  In closing, our journey with COSMO Loop is far from complete. The platform
  continues to evolve, with significant enhancements on the horizon. We're
  excited about the implementation of vector search technologies, which promise
  to bring a new level of precision and context-awareness to our search
  capabilities powered by our
  <a href="https://portal.cosmoconsult.com/" target="_blank">COSMO Platform</a>. Additionally,
  we're in the development stages of introducing a retrieval augmented
  generation (RAG) model, a sophisticated type of chatbot that will assist our
  consultants in writing comprehensive and high-quality user stories by drawing
  on a vast database of existing work items and documentation. These innovations
  underscore our commitment to not only maintaining but also elevating the
  standard of efficiency and support we provide to our Cosmonauts. Stay tuned
  for these updates, as they represent the next step in our relentless pursuit
  of excellence and innovation in project management and collaboration.
