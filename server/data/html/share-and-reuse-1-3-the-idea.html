    <p>Welcome to the first part of my blog series about the <strong>Share and Reuse</strong> culture from a technical perspective, where we&#8217;re peeling back the layers on a challenge that&#8217;s as exciting as it is relevant in our day-to-day operations. At <a href="https://www.cosmoconsult.com\" target="_blank">Cosmo Consult</a>, the company i am working for, we&#8217;re deeply immersed in the world of <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops\">Azure DevOps</a>, harnessing its power in all our software implementation projects. But with our expansive growth, branching into various entities and subsidiaries, we encountered a critical problem: the unintentional replication of solutions for our customers.</p><p>In a dynamic company like ours, it&#8217;s not uncommon to find different teams working in parallel, often unbeknownst to each other, to develop similar solutions for similar problems. This duplication isn&#8217;t a result of a lack of communication or collaboration. Instead, it stems from the sheer size of our organization and the diversity of projects we handle. Each team, focused on delivering the best to our clients, may end up reinventing the wheel that another team has already crafted.</p><p>Initially, our approach to tackle this issue was straightforward – actively promote the sharing of solutions across teams. We believed that if each team knew what the others were doing, we could easily avoid duplication. However, we soon realized the complexity of this task. In a company as large as Cosmo Consult, ensuring active participation from every individual &#8218;Cosmonaut&#8216;, was not just challenging; it was near impossible. The administrative overhead and the effort required to keep everyone in the <strong>loop</strong> was daunting.</p><p>That&#8217;s when the lightbulb went off. What if, instead of pushing information towards our Cosmonauts, we made it effortlessly accessible to them? This was the moment <strong>COSMO Loop</strong> began taking shape in our minds. Our objective shifted from active promotion to passive availability. We envisioned a tool that would allow our teams to easily access and leverage the wealth of solutions created daily within our Azure DevOps environment, without any added hassle or complexity.</p><p>The idea was simple yet powerful: create a central repository where all solutions developed for our clients are cataloged and easily retrievable. This would not just prevent the duplication of efforts but also foster a culture of sharing and innovation. Every Cosmonaut, regardless of their project or location, could tap into a collective repository of knowledge, learning from the solutions developed elsewhere in the organization, and applying them to their current challenges.</p><p>Here, it&#8217;s crucial to mention the paramount importance we placed on data privacy right from the onset. Working under Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs) with our customers, we were acutely aware of the sensitivity and confidentiality of the solutions we developed. Ensuring the security and privacy of this information was not just a necessity; it was an ethical obligation. Therefore, as we conceptualized <strong>COSMO Loop</strong>, we ensured that every aspect of the tool adhered to the strictest data privacy standards. We designed it to be a secure platform where solutions could be shared without compromising the confidentiality of our client&#8217;s information.</p><p>This marked the beginning of a transformative journey for us at Cosmo Consult. We were set to create something not just functional but revolutionary for our organization – a tool that aligned perfectly with our COSMO Code of collaboration and innovation.</p><p>In the next part of this series, we will dive into the development of our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for <strong>COSMO Loop</strong>, exploring the initial steps we took to turn this ambitious idea into a tangible tool. Stay tuned as we unfold the story of <strong>COSMO Loop</strong>, a journey from concept to creation.</p>
